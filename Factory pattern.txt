Factory Pattern:
The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. 
It abstracts the object creation process from the client, making the system more flexible and extensible."

. Real-World Analogy (Burger Example):
To make it relatable, use the burger shop analogy:

"Imagine a burger shop where you can order different types of burgers—like a Cheeseburger or a VeggieBurger. As a customer, you don't need to know the detailed steps of making these burgers (e.g., adding cheese or preparing a veggie patty); you just request the type of burger you want, and the shop prepares it for you. 
This is essentially what the Factory Pattern does in software—it hides the creation details and gives you the product based on your request."

. Why Use the Factory Pattern?
Explain why the Factory Pattern is useful:

"The Factory Pattern is used to encapsulate the instantiation of objects. Instead of creating objects directly using constructors, the client calls a factory method. This makes it easier to:

Add new products (e.g., adding a new ChickenBurger) without changing existing code.
Abstract object creation logic away from the client.
Promote loose coupling since the client doesn't need to know about the specific classes being instantiated."


. How the Factory Pattern Works (Code Example):
Now, explain the code step-by-step. Make sure to connect the analogy (burger shop) to the technical implementation.

Step 1: Abstract Class (Burger) "First, we define an abstract class Burger, which is the base product. 
This ensures that all specific burger types (like CheeseBurger and VeggieBurger) will implement a common method, prepare()."

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Step 1: Create an abstract class for the Product (Burger)
class Burger(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def prepare(self):
        pass

# Step 2: Create concrete classes for specific burgers (CheeseBurger, VeggieBurger)
class CheeseBurger(Burger):
    def prepare(self):
        return "Preparing a Cheese Burger with cheese, patty, and sauce."

class VeggieBurger(Burger):
    def prepare(self):
        return "Preparing a Veggie Burger with veggies, patty, and sauce."

# Step 3: Create the Burger Factory (No Static Method)
class BurgerFactory:
    def get_burger(self, burger_type):
        if burger_type == 'CheeseBurger':
            return CheeseBurger()
        elif burger_type == 'VeggieBurger':
            return VeggieBurger()
        else:
            return None

# Step 4: Client code using the factory
factory = BurgerFactory()

burger = factory.get_burger('CheeseBurger')
if burger:
    print(burger.prepare())  # Output: Preparing a Cheese Burger with cheese, patty, and sauce.

burger = factory.get_burger('VeggieBurger')
if burger:
    print(burger.prepare())  # Output: Preparing a Veggie Burger with veggies, patty, and sauce.


Advantages of Factory Pattern:
After explaining the example, highlight the key benefits:

Loose Coupling: "The client and the specific burger classes are decoupled. The client only interacts with the factory, and the factory handles which concrete class to instantiate."
Single Responsibility: "The factory class handles the responsibility of creating objects, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle."
Scalability: "If we want to add a new burger type, like ChickenBurger, we simply create a new class and update the factory method without changing the client code."

Abstraction: The client code doesn't need to know the details of how objects are instantiated. It just makes requests to the factory.
Loose Coupling: The client code is decoupled from the specific classes (CheeseBurger, VeggieBurger). It only interacts with the BurgerFactory, making it easier to extend or change the system later.
Flexibility: If you add a new burger type (like ChickenBurger), you don't need to modify the client code. The factory can handle the new burger type, and the client just requests it by name.


! The Factory Pattern simplifies the process of object creation, especially when dealing with multiple types of products, by abstracting away the construction details.
 Instead of the client creating objects directly through constructors and managing the intricacies of the object’s ingredients or configuration, the client simply calls the factory to create the object.

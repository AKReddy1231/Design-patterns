    Builder pattern:

def:"The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing clients to customize each part of the object in sequence. It’s especially useful for objects with many optional configurations, avoiding cluttered constructors.
This pattern is especially useful when creating objects with many optional parameters or configurations, as it keeps the construction code organized and prevents the need for lengthy constructors with multiple arguments.

code:
  violating builder pattern:
   
class Burger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buns = None
        self.patty = None
        self.cheese = None

    def setBuns(self, bunStyle):
        self.buns = bunStyle
    
    def setPatty(self, pattyStyle):
        self.patty = pattyStyle
    
    def setCheese(self, cheeseStyle):
        self.cheese = cheeseStyle

class BurgerBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.burger = Burger()

    def addBuns(self, bunStyle):
        self.burger.setBuns(bunStyle)
        # Notice the absence of `return self`

    def addPatty(self, pattyStyle):
        self.burger.setPatty(pattyStyle)
        # Notice the absence of `return self`

    def addCheese(self, cheeseStyle):
        self.burger.setCheese(cheeseStyle)
        # Notice the absence of `return self`

    def build(self):
        return self.burger

builder = BurgerBuilder()
builder.addBuns("sesame")
builder.addPatty("fish-patty")
builder.addCheese("swiss cheese")
burger = builder.build()

Issues with This Code
No Method Chaining:

Each method call requires a separate line, which makes the code more verbose.
The return self in each builder method allows for chaining, making the code more readable and fluid. Without it, the readability and elegance of the builder pattern are lost.
Violates the Builder Pattern's Fluent Interface:

The Builder Pattern is often designed to allow clients to configure the product in a step-by-step manner with a fluent interface.
Without return self, this fluent interface is broken, leading to less intuitive code.

When method chaining is absent:

More Lines of Code: Each configuration step takes a separate line, which increases development time and verbosity.
Reduced Efficiency: The lack of a fluent, step-by-step approach makes customization less efficient and intuitive.

code Adhering builder pattern:

class Burger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buns = None
        self.patty = None
        self.cheese = None

    def setBuns(self, bunStyle):
        self.buns = bunStyle
    
    def setPatty(self, pattyStyle):
        self.patty = pattyStyle
    
    def setCheese(self, cheeseStyle):
        self.cheese = cheeseStyle
class BurgerBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.burger = Burger()

    def addBuns(self, bunStyle):
        self.burger.setBuns(bunStyle)
        return self
    
    def addPatty(self, pattyStyle):
        self.burger.setPatty(pattyStyle)
        return self
    
    def addCheese(self, cheeseStyle):
        self.burger.setCheese(cheeseStyle)
        return self  

    def build(self):
        return self.burger

burger = BurgerBuilder() \
            .addBuns("sesame") \
            .addPatty("fish-patty") \
            .addCheese("swiss cheese") \
            .build()
advantages:

Step-by-Step Construction: The builder lets clients add components one by one (buns, patty, cheese), promoting flexibility.
Readability: Method chaining makes it easy to read and understand the construction process at a glance.
Encapsulation: The burger’s creation details are 
encapsulated in BurgerBuilder, keeping the client code clean.
Customization: The builder pattern here allows for easy customization, enabling the creation of different types of burgers without complex constructors.
Short and Impressive Interview Explanation

summary:

The Builder Pattern helps create complex objects by providing a step-by-step construction process, making the code flexible and readable. In this example, BurgerBuilder constructs a customizable Burger by letting clients choose each ingredient sequentially through method chaining.
 This pattern is ideal for situations with many configuration options, as it improves code organization and keeps object creation flexible and easy to understand.”

Builder Pattern with Chaining is Time-Efficient: It’s easier and faster to configure objects in a single sequence, which aligns well with the Builder Pattern’s goal of simplifying complex object creation.

In short, using return self in the Builder Pattern is both time-efficient and structurally beneficial by enhancing readability, maintainability, and ease of customization.
